# One Word

This is a simple application that displays a word and its definition and invites the user to discover others.

I had the idea for this application because my two children haven't been reading for some time, and I want them to have some vocabulary. I'm convinced that knowing the meaning of a word means knowing yourself a little better.

To develop this application, I used cursor's new AI, compose, the result of the code is certainly perfectible. The aim here was to see if I could get a result as quickly as possible.
